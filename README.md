# Brew journal

## What is it?

This started out as my first Angular app back in 2019 keeping info about beers I brewed.

### Initial state

Data was kept in MySQL database, obtained by simple PHP API and returned to the app in JSON format.

### Current state

I started updating the project in 2024 to showcase both my front-end and back-end programming skills. It still uses Angular on client side (v17) but I moved the API to Java and Spring-boot Framework. Everything is hosted on Google Cloud Platform.

## Plans

Plans for further development can be found in TODO.md (outdated)

## Try it

Working demo is available [here](https://brew-journal.web.app).
